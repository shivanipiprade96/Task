# Task
Let cm be a sequence defined by:
cm(n+1) :=
(
cm(n)=2 for cm(n) is even
cm(n) * 3 + 1 for cm(n) is uneven
with cm(1) := m and m; n 2 N
Independent of the starting value all known sequences end in repeating 1; 4; 2.
a) Implement a program to calculate the number of steps to reach 1 the
first time for any given m 2 N.
b) Adapt the implementation to calculate the number of steps for each
m 2 [1; 10000].
c) Try to improve the implementation to calculate the steps as fast as
possbile.
d) Print the number of steps for each m 2 [1; 10000] as diagram.
